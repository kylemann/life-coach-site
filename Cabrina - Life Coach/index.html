  <div class="mask4"></div>
        <p>We help you develop realistic and attainable goals that create progress in your personal and/or professional life. The first session is to examine a general challenge, obstacle to overcome and intended goal.</p>
<p>The clients goal is to record "triggers" that prevent progress and to also write "moments" of progress to share during future sessions. Sessions vary based on the situation, motivation and drive of the client. Appointments are conducted live,via Skype and/or phone calls.</p>
                  <p>Consultants help improve individuals and companies by assessing weaknesses and recommending solutions. The team at "The Experience" take the time to learn, assess and create SMART action plans to help every client drive results.</p>
        <p>We strive for clients to open up to a new way of implementing change and embracing a "new experience" which will help them achieve their goals</p>
