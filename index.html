                <p>As your coach, we help you develop realistic and attainable goals that generate progress in your personal and professional life. It begins with a conversation to examine your challenges or obstacles and then we create goals toward change.</p>
                <p>The client's goal is to record triggers that prevent progress and to also write moments of progress to share during future sessions. Sessions vary based on the situation and motivation of the client. Appointments are offered live, via Skype or on the phone.
</p>
            <p>Our consultants help improve individuals and companies by evaluating weaknesses and recommending solutions. We take the time to learn, assess and create <span class="small-caps">smart</span> action plans to help every client drive results.</p>
        <p>We strive for clients to open up to a new way of implementing change and embracing a "new experience" which will help them achieve their goals.</p>

      Cabrina's talent is people; it's just that simple.   Her insight, her ability to listen, and then ask the kinds of thoughtful questions that initiates new and clearer thinking - she understands and hears her clients before they do! Cabrina has personally mentored me, and helped me gain the deeper understanding that has enabled me to maneuver through corporate environments more successfully, as well as personal relationships.   
I value how she challenges me to think differently

I have had a professional relationship with Cabrina for over ten years now, having first worked with her within the hotel business where Cabrina served as a General Manager at a hotel within our portfolio.  Since then, I have moved onto other hotel companies and have ultimately started my own consulting agency.  I have employed and sub-contracted Cabrina on several occasions to provide professional development to my team members, or lead training programs for various corporate hotel clients.  Her coaching skills are flexible for the audience, her training development and presentation skills are superb and her motivational presentations have always reinvigorated my team members.

<div class="quote"><img src="images/quote.svg" alt="Quotation Mark"></div>I had the pleasure of partnering with Cabrina for 4 years in the Learning and Development field. Cabrina's broad and holistic approach to the personal and professional development was inspiring to me in not just adjusting my methods of talent progression, but also in connecting with people.
Developing a self confidence in yourself is one of the most powerful arsenals in the professional world today. Through my own development and work, Cabrina's partnership was there as a foundation, support and positive reinforcement to keep going - especially through the unknowns of taking risk for self achievement. A lesson in life and leadership that Cabrina exhibits is to simply do what makes you happy, all else will fall into place.
